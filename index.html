                <p>
                    I'm a junior attending Greenwich Country Day School, in Greenwich, CT. <br> <br>
                    My main interests include mathematics, coding, machine learning, and 3D design and printing. I am the youngest ever co-captain of the <a class="mpglink" href="https://www.instagram.com/gcdscs/" target="_blank">GCDS Computer Science Team</a>, and I placed highly in the <a class="mpglink" href="http://inside.gcschool.org/abacus/paul-erdos-international-hall-fame/#:~:text=THIRD%20PLACE%3A%20Imran%20Aidan%20Iftikar%2C%20The%20Greenwich%20Country%20Day%20School%2C%20Greenwich%2C%20CT%2C%20USA" target="_blank">Paul Erdos International Math Challenge</a> for three years in a row during my youth.<br> <br>
                    <!-- Having completed calculus as a freshmen, I began researching AI from a first principles, mathematical perspective. As part of my research, I coded a linear-algebra Python library with no external libraries and without the use of the "math" library. <br> <br> -->
                    As a social entreprenuer, I led a team in designing and prototyping affordable, foldable, and self-funded homes for the homeless in India. To implement this project, I was co-awarded the inaugural President George H.W. Bush, GCDS â€™37, Public Service Grant. <br> <br>
                    I like to write about and document my learning, including projects, books I read, experiences of mine, etc. My writing has won a scholastic Gold Key award. <br> <br>
                    I also  like photography, hanging out with my friends, and I love (to a fault, perhaps) Star Wars.
